Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as a central core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters.[9] Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle and has the fourth-highest capacity of any rocket ever built, trailing the American Saturn V, the Soviet Energia, and the never-successful Soviet N1.
SpaceX conducted Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC).[5][10][11] The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk as a dummy payload.[12][13]

Falcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit, especially to the Moon, Mars, and potentially to asteroids for mining, although as of February 2018 Musk does not plan to apply for a human-rating certification to carry NASA astronauts.[14] Falcon Heavy and other current Falcon launch vehicles are to be replaced by the BFR ("Big Falcon Rocket") by the early 2020s.[15]
